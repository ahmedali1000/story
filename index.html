            <p>Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show was both produced and filmed in Belfast and elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p></div>
            <div class="d1"><img src="9.png">
            <p>Although the first season closely follows the events of the first novel, later seasons have made significant changes. According to David Benioff, the TV adaptation is "about adapting the series as a whole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily each of the stops along the way</p></div>
            <div class="d1"><img src="6.jpg">
            <p> Game of Thrones has several plots and a large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs. One arc is about the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and follows a web of alliances and conflicts among the noble dynasties either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from it.</p></div>
            <div class="d1"><img src="4.jpg">
            <p>Another focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled and is plotting a return to the throne, while another story arc follows the Night's Watch, a brotherhood defending the realm against the fierce peoples and legendary creatures of the North.</p></div>
            <div class="d1"><img src="5.jpg">
            <p>Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series was acclaimed by critics for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) was criticized; the final season received further criticism for its condensed story and creative decisions, with many considering it a disappointing conclusion.</p></div>
            <div class="d1"><img src="8.jpg">
            <p>The novels and their adaptations base aspects of their settings, characters, and plot on events in European history.[47] Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high medieval Europe, from lands and cultures,[48] to the palace intrigue, feudal system, castles, and knightly tournaments. A principal inspiration for the novels is the English Wars of the Roses[49] (1455â€“1485) between the houses of Lancaster and York</p></div>
            <div class="d1"><img src="3.jpg">
            <p>After Game of Thrones began outpacing the published novels in the sixth season, the series was based on a plot outline of the future novels provided by Martin[66] and original content. In April 2016, the showrunners' plan was to shoot 13 more episodes after the sixth season: seven episodes in the seventh season and six episodes in the eighth.</p></div>
